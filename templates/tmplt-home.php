                        <p>Actors meet in 3 groups for weekly rehearsals - Players (ages 8-12), Classics (ages 12-16) and Guild (by invitation). Although the rehearsal groups meet separately each week, the members of the Players, Classics, and Guild all work on a single production. Coming together on occasional weekend rehearsals, and then every day during Production Week, all actors ultimately create a cohesive, high quality production that bonds them together as creative collaborators. The Director and production team approach each production as a “hand made” creative project that requires complete devotion. All together, this creates not only great art, but a transformative experience that benefits our actors for life!</p>

                    Lumina Studio Theatre supports the work of BIPOC organizers and activists calling for an acknowledgement of and end to systemic racism, including in the world of theatre. Lumina’s core value of originality encourages young people and adults alike to question and engage in critical discussion not only of Shakespeare, but of much of the Western Literary “canon.” Lumina Studio Theatre is engaging in an ongoing process of education and self-reflection regarding how we as an organization can do more and do better in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. This education process includes attending workshops on anti-racist theater making (like <a href="https://www.nicolembrewer.com/ctt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anti-Racist Theatre: A Foundational Course</a>) to help Lumina move from passive assimilationism to active anti-racism. Co-Executive Directors Sophie Cameron and Meg Lebow recognize that as White community members, their role is to listen to and uplift the voices of community members of color and take actionable steps to move the organization towards anti-racism and encourage our peer organizations to do the same. For more information on equity in the arts, please visit the <a href="https://www.creativemoco.com/equity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Montgomery County Arts and Humanities Council List of Resources on Racial Justice and Equity</a>.

I was extremely impressed with the great work that Lumina got out of the students.  Not only did they know exactly what they were saying at every moment, they were also very clear on their characters, relationships, and the whole story. The young Lumina actors took very challenging Shakespeare and really owned it. They were poised, confident, and well-directed.  Not only that, but they were having a great time!  Congratulations, Lumina, for pulling off a near-miracle: getting kids to put on a Shakespeare play at a high level at such a young age.  Keep up the great work!”</h2>
