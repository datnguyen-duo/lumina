                    <p>
                        Lumina Studio Theatre’s mission is to provide unique opportunities for young actors of any level of experience who seek to perform Shakespeare, other plays of the classical repertory theatre, and modern plays that focus on the beauty of language.<br><br>
                        Lumina provides a disciplined and rigorous professional setting where actors are trained in a comprehensive, performance-focused program of theatre arts based on Rudolf Steiner’s Creative Speech and Drama techniques. The techniques of Stella Adler and Michael Chekhov are also demonstrated and put into practice. Our program includes in-depth vocal and character coaching, improvisation, and stage-combat training, detailed costumes, live music, choreography and occasionally special elements such as masks to support the shows. The results are exhilarating and thoughtful productions that demand more of our aspiring actors, and benefit them for life.

                Since 1997 Lumina has worked with over 600 young actors and enjoys a 95% retention rate from season to season. Some alumni have gone on to major in theatre and attend prestigious theatre schools such as NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. Many alumni also return for guest appearances in current productions and work as Directors in the Summerstock program, thus giving back to the next generation of Lumina actors.

                                    Lumina Studio Theatre made its debut on October 5, 1995 in Brooklyn, NY at Promote Art Works, Inc. as a new concept in teaching speech and drama. Jillian Raye, Founder and Artistic Director, built Lumina on the belief that young actors can perform brilliantly using the classics in imaginative ways; that actors and audiences can grow from barrier-free, intergenerational performances; and that theatre discipline and creativity are soul mates that belong to the entire community.

                                    Raye moved the organization to Takoma Park, MD, in 1997. Beginning with a few young people rehearsing in Ms. Raye’s basement and performing in an old movie theatre, Lumina has flourished and now attracts over 100 young actors per season from across the metropolitan area. Lumina offers many opportunities for participants: Folk Tale Camps for the youngest actors (age 8+) to the Theatre Group for adult actors. Lumina presents nine productions each season.

                                    In 2008, Lumina mourned the passing of Jillian Raye after her long struggle with breast cancer. In spite of this devastating loss, Lumina continues to grow, as Jillian would have wanted under the leadership of David Minton as Artistic Director. Her creative vision continues to be a source of inspiration to everyone in the Lumina family.

                                    In 2020, Lumina moved out of its longtime home at 620 Pershing Drive. From April of 2020-May 2021, all of Lumina’s programming moved online as a result of the COVID pandemic. In this time, Lumina youth performed in 5 virtual productions, and the Lumina Theatre Group produced over 15 staged readings. All of Lumina’s virtual productions are available to watch for free on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/LuminaStudioTheatre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.youtube.com/LuminaStudioTheatre</a>. Lumina’s Ensemble group wrote and produced an episodic science-fiction podcast, The Zeno Paradox Podcast, displaying creativity and insight as they were forced to pivot to an artform that could be done while social distancing.

Today, Lumina’s offices and rehearsal space are located in the Silver Spring Black Box, which Lumina helps manage as part of the Theatre Consortium of Silver Spring. Under Cameron and Lebow’s leadership, Lumina Studio Theatre continues to build on our rich heritage, advance its unique model of youth inspired classics, and bring high-quality performances to the community.

                                        Victorian Literature. Her graduate studies have focused
                                        on Victorian attitudes towards actors and acting.
                                        She brings an anti-racist framework to the study of “The Classics.”
                                        Meg has directed a preschool program and led poetry workshops at
                                        Blue Monarch, a rehabilitative facility for women. She became
